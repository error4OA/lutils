# lutils
luvit utilities, i guess

adds functions that arent in luvit

## installation process
download `lutils.lua` and add it to your project folder

then put this in the main file

```lua
local lutils = require("lutils")
```

## explanation

`lutils:URLify()` - good for making requests that need text

`lutils:split()` - as my friend says, a ripoff of `string.sub()`

`lutils:tableContains()` - searches for a certain object in a certain table
